4. Results: We trained 5 models on minimumn, middle, max exposure, and all exposures for the effnetV2. That is 9-channel image. 17 models in total
We recorded the accuracy metrix to compare the network to experts, and Mean squared error was used as the loss function.
The accuracy are shown in table 4. B5 min, B6-middle with 74.4% accuracy
Minimum exposure was best with mean of 73.3% B5 was best network 73.7% 

5. The results of the 17 models was obtained as the average prediction on the test set from 10-fold cross-validation.
Here we see the distribution of the 10 folds for each model. 
The blue bars are the ensemble score for accuracy and mean squared error, and the red bars are the best ensembles
The orange bar is the average of the 10 folds.

Looking at the left table accuracy:We see that medium -all and large all has a very small variance.
and B5-max very large variance
looking at the right table Mean squared error: we see that two models, B5-max and B6-max, has large variance 

6. Table 8 shows binomial combination of simple average ensembles on 2 to 17 models.
We see that the best ensemble is found with a combination of 6 models where the search space is more than 12000 models, 
and the best average ensembles are found with a combination of 9 models where the search space is more than 24000.

Looking at the rank statistics we see that B4-min and B6-min participate in most of the best ensembles, each participating in 15 of the 16 best ensembles.
Looking at the average rank accross image exposure we find that
Min had an average rank of 4, middle 9, all 10, and max 11

7. All the models had correlated coefficient of between .98 and .99. 
Figure 13 shows the scatterplot of the residual of the prediction on the test-set between 2 of the least correlated models. Medium-min and B5-min
The inner most ring shows misprediction of .5 years, the outermost  1.5 years
We see that the 2 models agreeeven on large outliers.

9. Outliers with more than 1.5 years - Some otoliths were outliers to all models on all exposures - like image 71,342, 362, 369 in red)
sow otoliths where outliers to a family of models and on all exposures - like image 13 missed by the B networks

image 279 in upper right: Labeled as 8 years, read as 10 years all models except B6-max. The
exposures is of good quality, but there were split rings in the middle
