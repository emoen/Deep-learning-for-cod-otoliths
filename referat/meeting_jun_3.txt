    -changed "implemented" to "imported and modified"
x -imagenet - weights - version of keras and give url, also for pytorch
    - Is imagenet weights part of the paper on EfficientNet and EfficentNetV2?
-Simple ensemble learning with averaging: mixing background and what is done.
	mention alternative. Describe ensemble of ensemble
	we take the average of ensembles and then round

	- simple mean of the 10-fold ensembles, simple mean of these ensembles, Simple ensemble average

v -figure 7 make smaler font
v -outliers - put in tables, makes bulletpoints the summary
