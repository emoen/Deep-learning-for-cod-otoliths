In Methods: 
- Describe the archtecture with number of layers, resolution, width.

-Hyper-parameters 
  in supplementary materials + architecture overview table
  details on hyperparameters - short & with reference

In Results:
Analysis: e.g B4 vs v2 large - show statistical significanse

Create plot:
1. accuracy pr age group
2. prediction vs prediction - each year has different color - or using reciduals.
3. Do we have access to month of prediction?

On holdout test-set: 1. physical otolith, 2. read from image, 3. then CNN read
