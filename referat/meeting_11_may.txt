referat 11 mai:
1. Google doc has introduction
2. Introduction: add history of CNNs
v 3. Methods: Photographic protocol” start by mentioning savahans work
4. Rescaling on CNNs chapter not in first methods
5. "near the bottom of the camera." - not the case. Correct to: "The procimal surface should be up or down"
6. Move table 1 to ensembles
7. line 76 and line 88 pixels size 512
8. EfficeintNetV2 and EfficientNet different regressors
9. subtract the mean
10. Resizing images: "The pixel values 117 has a range between 0 and 255 which was normalized to between 0 and 1."
11. Remove: The augmented data set can produce 360×2×5150 = 3.708.000 possible images.
12. 10-fold cross validation rephrase on line 126
13. Define target audience - target people working on otoliths and techniqual (ecological info, ICES)
14. The best model-parameters on the validation set was then used to predict the age on the test-set
15. combine table 3, 4, 5
16. Scheduler on TF: min_lr 1e-06, weight_decay 1e-06
17. Introduction/Disussion move: Simple ensemble learning with averaging
18. Inconsistency in tenses - present, past, future. Use past tense
19. Conclusions in beginning of results
20. dont use stars - use bold-face
21. table 6. compare accuracy - add only red channels, or put a channel infront with 9 channels
22. generality: how well does the network perform on other exposures.
23. table 6 add the average for each column/row
24. Remove: It looks like the residuals follow a normal-like distribution.
25. Limit figure 6, 7, and 8
26. ensembles - pick a random fold for each of the models - get the distribution for each of the 
27. Double-check rank - sort it by count.
28. Check time to do inference for each model - time x ensemble
29. Correlation in appendix
30. HCA - good relation - y-axis what is the unit (is it correlation difference)
31. The B's are also correlated by exposures also
32. Mention accuracy on 90's on for 1-2 year olds
33. figure 6 add bar from -0.5, 0.5, x:[-2.5, 2.5] 
34. Remove figure 12 add elbow - silhouett score method.
